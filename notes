Assumptions:
1.	A single commercial paper Fabric network
2.	Composer tooling runs the network and defines a Company participant
3.	Each company operates its own Composer REST server to interact with the network
4.	There are no participants other than Company (i.e. no "roles" like Investor, Issuer, etc.)

Ideas:
1.	Each of IBM's micro-services which need access to the commercial paper network would be their own user within the REST server
		a.	For example, a commercial paper management UI would be cp-manage, an auditing UI may be cp-audit
2.	The IBM user contains an identity which ties it the participant, in this Company
		a.	If down the line, the participant "Company" was removed and replaced with different participants which have roles/permissions,
			for example Investor, Issuer, Auditor, etc., then the User would have the appropriate identity assigned to it
		b.	It would be helpful to have a user specify the identity he wants to use in the REST request rather than setting a default
3.	The front-end will have to be added to the REST server and have an identity issued to it before hand, and it is then essentially handed
	an access token which is how it will authenticate its requests from now on
		a.	The access token remains valid forever
		b.	The access token can be invalidated and refreshed regularly by the back-end server for added security
